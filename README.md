# koa-mongo-starter
A boilerplate [koaJS](http://koajs.com/) setup, using MongoDB as the backend database, 
structured in a sensible way, including common libraries for routing, configuration, logging, and database access.

## Motivation
KoaJS is a very minimalistic, unopinionated node framework, providing a thin layer of abstraction 
over the base node libraries, and while this provides the developer with maximum flexibility,
a part of the code is repeated accross similar projects. 

This repository aims to include that part of the code, using tried and tested libraries of the node ecosystem.
By no means is this project an attempt to cover all use cases. Instead, it focuses on a specific setup that
I have found is convenient when working with a Mongo database.
